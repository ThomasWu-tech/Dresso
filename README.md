## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### 2. Frontend Setup
The frontend uses CDN-hosted scripts for React and Tailwind CSS, so no complex build step is required. Simply open the HTML files in your browser.

For local development, you can use a simple live server (like the VS Code Live Server extension) to serve the root directory.

- **UI Consistency**: Standardized header styles and navigation across the Closet, Generator, and AI Outfit screens.
